# No Phantoms Spigot Plugin
A tiny plugin for Minecraft Spigot servers that replaces the pesky Phantoms with shooting-star-cookies and adds a custom recipe for Phantom Membranes.

## About

This is a tiny plugin that was created as a party prod during [CaGGtus 2023](https://www.caggtus.de/) because Struntzi, Griefed and I agreed on having enough of those pesky Phantoms and we need/want a plugin to get rid of them.

### No more Phantoms

Whenever the game tries to spawn a Phantom, it's replaced by a cookie that drops from the sky - way more friendly and even has a nice sparkle effect while it's falling down to the ground.

This way you never have to worry about these creatures disturbing you.

### Crafting Phantom Membranes

However, the Phantom Membranes, they usually drop when killed, are needed to repair Elytras!

This plugin adds a new recipe to simply craft those, now:

- A feather, an amethyst shard, another feather on the middle row of the crafting ingredients, in this order => Phantom Membrane

## Collab

The plugin was created with a lot of fun in kind of a pair programming way by:

- [Struntzi](https://github.com/Struntzi)
- [Griefed](https://github.com/Griefed)
- [and me (HELLCAT)](https://github.com/TheHellcat)
